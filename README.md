# 🚀 Rectangular Prism Calculator - TDD Assignment

## 🧠 Description
This project demonstrates the use of **Test Driven Development (TDD)** to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism using the formula:

> 📐 **Volume = Height × Width × Length**

---

## 🗂️ The project includes:
- The main code that calculates the volume of rectangular prism
- Unit tests to support the TDD process
- A list of additional tests to be implemented if get a chance to implement

---

## ✅ Implemented Tests
- Valid input
- Input contains zero
- Input contains negative value
- Input contains all zero
- Input contains Large Value

## 🔭 Tests Planned But Not Implemented
- Test with floating point numbers
- Test with Negative floating point numbers
- Test with Missing parameters
- Test with Extra parameters (More than 3)
- Test with Extremely Large input values
- Test with non alphanumeric input values
